# Card-Matching-Game-Android
This is a card mathing andoird game with the three levels created using android studio.Every image is stored in pair and they have to find out the pair.This game was tricky to made as its design needs to be simple and the game should work without any hassle and they can easily play game.So I decided to have 3 levels in the game.

First level will have 4 image buttons which means 2 image pair and it will have 3 sub levels. Second level have 8 image buttons and have 2 sub levels. Final level have 12 image buttons and only there is one level. This was decided so the game is not too long and boring. There were many problems which occur during the implementation one of them it was that game was crashing after the images which were in sub button were no matching this was a bug which was handled by providing tag to each button and that tag represents the position of button and images are stored in array so whenever image button is pressed it takes tag from it and gets the image from the array. Second problem with the code was that it was having same image in the same position so shuffe method was applied to shuffe the image values in array and get the different image for the particular position of image button every time. Next bug was that it was crashing every time when it was starting the sub level which was tackle in the appropriate way. The another bug found was that when one card is pressed and then the same card is pressed again it matches and points are awarded this bug was tackled by enabling the button which is pressed once to false so this image button would not work if once pressed and it will only work after two different cards are open.
